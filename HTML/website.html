            <h1>Red apples are better than green apples</h1>
            <p>Red apples are undoubtedly the superior choice when it comes to flavor, texture, and versatility. Their natural sweetness is unmatched, making them the perfect choice for snacking, juicing, or baking without the need for added sugar. The tender, crisp texture of red apples is far more satisfying than the sometimes tough and sour bite of green varieties. Not only do they provide a more balanced, enjoyable eating experience, but their vibrant, glossy color also makes them far more visually appealing. Simply put, red apples are the all-around winner in terms of taste, enjoyment, and use in a variety of culinary applications.</p>
            <p>More reasons red apples are better:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>contain nearly five times as much anthocyanins as Granny Smiths</li>
                <li>More fiber, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamin K. </li>
                <li>Red</li>
                <li>Red</li>
                <li>Red</li>
                <li>Red</li>
                <li>Not Green</li>
